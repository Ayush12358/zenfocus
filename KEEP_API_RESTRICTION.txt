The error `invalid_scope` persists because enabling the API in Google Cloud Console is **not enough**.

The specific scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/keep` is classified as **Restricted** by Google.
This means:
1.  It is **ONLY** available to verified apps or internal apps within a Google Workspace organization (Enterprise/Education).
2.  It is **BLOCKED** for personal Gmail accounts (`@gmail.com`) unless the app goes through a security audit by Google (which costs money).

**Conclusion:** You physically cannot use the Google Keep API with a personal Gmail account for this project.

I have disabled the scope again so you can log in. You will have to use the **Local Notes** feature I built.
